# ML_Student
This project is my first journey to the ML world.

Using ML this program can predict your final grade basing on few parameters like:
first period grade - G1 (numeric: from 0 to 20)
second period grade - G2 (numeric: from 0 to 20)
studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours)
failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4)
absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)

Just run gui_ML_student, but make sure that you have all libraries!
